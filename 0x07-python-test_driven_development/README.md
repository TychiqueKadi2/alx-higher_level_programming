# 0x07. Python - Test-driven development

This directory contains programs written in Python for the purpose of learning and practicing test-driven development.

## Files

Below is a list of all the files in this directory and their descriptions:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-add_integer.py` | Python function that returns the integer addition of two numbers. If either of `a` or `b` is not an `int` or `float`, a `TypeError` is raised with the message `a must be an integer` or `b must be an integer`. If either of `a` or `b` is a `float`, it is casted to an `int` before addition. |
| `2-matrix_divided.py` | Python function that divides all elements of a matrix by a common divisor. Returns a new matrix representing the division of all elements of matrix by `div`. Quotients are rounded to two decimal places. |
| `3-say_my_name.py` | Python function that prints `My name is <first name> <last name>` or `My name is <first name>` depending on the number of arguments passed. |
| `4-print_square.py` | Python function that prints a square of size `size` using the `#` character. |
| `5-text_indentation.py` | Python function that prints a text with 2 new lines after each of these characters: `.`, `?`, and `:`. |
| `6-max_integer.py` | Python function that finds the maximum integer in a list of integers. |
| `100-matrix_mul.py` | Python function that multiplies 2 matrices. |
| `101-lazy_matrix_mul.py` | Python function that multiplies 2 matrices using the module `NumPy`. |

## Requirements

* All files are written and compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python3 (version 3.8.5)
* Code uses the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.)

## Acknowledgments

* This project was completed as part of the curriculum for the ALX Software Engineering program.
