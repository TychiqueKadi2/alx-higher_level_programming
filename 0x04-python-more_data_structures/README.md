0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

This project is about learning more about data structures in Python. The following topics are covered:

What are set and how to use them
What are the most common methods of set and how to use them
When to use sets versus lists
How to iterate into a set
What are dictionary and how to use them
When to use dictionaries versus lists or sets
What is a key in a dictionary
How to iterate into a dictionary
What is a lambda function
What is map, reduce and filter functions
